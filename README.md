# Hearthstone Quiz
Hearthstone is a fast-paced strategy card game that's easy to learn and massively fun.

The game allows you to earn gold, card packs and dust. Gold can be used to buy card packs, play in the arena or buy solo adventures. Card packs are always full of random cards that you can collect and use to craft new decks. Dust can be used to create any card you want!

Game modes : 

**Single Player Adventures** – these are where you play against the computer in a themed environment. Every time a new Hearthstone season begins a full expansion of cards comes out and usually a new single player adventure along with it.

**Casual Play** – you play against a randomly selected opponent.

**Ranked Play** – you play against a randomly selected opponent. The more games you win the higher you rank, until you eventually rank Legend. The higher the rank the more rewards you get each month (like extra gold, dust, and cards)

**Tavern Brawl** – This is a weekly event where players get to play special matches (sometimes against other players, sometimes against the computer), with special rules.

The purpose of this Hearthstone quiz is mostly fun. By answering a few questions, you can get a general idea of what Hero may suit you. 

Hero cards represent the players in the game. They govern how much health the players have remaining, what cards they can put in their deck, and detail the style of the deck.

Players start with a hero from a particular class that then determines what other cards can be utilized or included in the deck. For example, a hero with the rogue class would allow you to play a Rogue's signature attack, Backstab.

During the game, standard heroes can use emotes (6 basic emotes) during the match as a minimal form of communication with the other player.

Each hero has a Class, and a Hero Power (an ability that can be used once per turn for a cost).

When your opponent's hero's Health is reduced to 0, you win the game.
